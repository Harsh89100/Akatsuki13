# 🚀 Space Station Object Detection using YOLOv8

This project implements an object detection system using the **YOLOv8** model to detect objects (e.g., fire extinguishers, toolboxes, oxygen tanks) in synthetic images of a **space station**. The dataset was generated using **FalconEditor**, simulating complex environments with varying lighting, occlusion, overlapping objects, and different camera angles/distances.

## 🗂️ Dataset

The dataset was synthetically generated using **FalconEditor** and follows the YOLO format:
